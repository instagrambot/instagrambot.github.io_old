<meta name="description" content="Instructions for use Important! Read the instructions from start to finish, and then act! Good luck! How to work? You will need a downloaded project. In the instabot/examples/ folder there are scripts for work. How do I run the script? Open the command line, use cd to go to the project directory, namely instabot/examples. Type. python name.py param Where name is the name of the script, param is the required parameter for running the script. Not all scripts need a parameter. How do I know if I need an input parameter for a script? Run the script by typing. python name.py If there are no necessary parameters, the script will stop and display an error. Example. Run the script. python like_hashtags.py. The script stops and displays a message: error: the following arguments are required: hashtags. That is, we had to enter a hashtag. Correct example: python like_hashtags.py follow All inclusive multi_script_CLI.py is a script that contains all the functions. The first time you run it, you will be prompted to configure the script. Script settings are stored in the setting.txt file. Also files will be created: hashtag_file.txt, users_file.txt, whitelist.txt, blacklist.txt, comment.txt. 24/7 Yes, there is a script that rounds up subscribers and subscriptions of certain people around the clock, and also likes photos by nickname and hashtag. All this allows the script - ultimate.py, which is in the instabot/examples/ultimate folder. The folder also contains other text files for running the script.

This parameter is like_delay. This parameter needs to be set to 60, since we need every minute the bot to be happy with the photo on the hashtag.

<p><strong>Important! Read the instructions from start to finish, and then act! Good luck!</strong></p>

<h2 id="how-to-work">How to work?</h2>

<p>You will need a downloaded project. In the <strong><em>instabot/examples/</em></strong> folder there are scripts for work.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-run-the-script">How do I run the script?</h2>

<p>Open the command line, use <strong><em>cd</em></strong> to go to the project directory, namely <strong><em>instabot/examples</em></strong>. Type.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span> <span class="n">param</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Where <strong><em>name</em></strong> is the name of the script, <strong><em>param</em></strong> is the required parameter for running the script. Not all scripts need a parameter.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-know-if-i-need-an-input-parameter-for-a-script">How do I know if I need an input parameter for a script?</h2>

<p>Run the script by typing.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If there are no necessary parameters, the script will stop and display an error.
Example.
Run the script.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">like_hashtags</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span><span class="o">.</span> 
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The script stops and displays a message:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">error</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">following</span> <span class="n">arguments</span> <span class="n">are</span> <span class="n">required</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">hashtags</span><span class="o">.</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That is, we had to enter a hashtag. Correct example:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">like_hashtags</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span> <span class="n">follow</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="all-inclusive">All inclusive</h2>

<p><strong><em>multi_script_CLI.py</em></strong> is a script that contains all the functions. The first time you run it, you will be prompted to configure the script. Script settings are stored in the <strong><em>setting.txt</em></strong> file. Also files will be created: <strong><em>hashtag_file.txt, users_file.txt, whitelist.txt, blacklist.txt, comment.txt</em></strong>.</p>

<h2 id="247">24/7</h2>

<p>Yes, there is a script that rounds up subscribers and subscriptions of certain people around the clock, and also likes photos by nickname and hashtag. All this allows the script - <strong><em>ultimate.py</em></strong>, which is in the <strong><em>instabot/examples/ultimate</em></strong> folder. The folder also contains other text files for running the script. In these files, each new parameter needs to be written from a new line.</p>

<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>

<p>Also there is a script that will work around the clock, BUT this script will act according to plan. This script is <strong><em>ultimate.py</em></strong> in the <strong><em>instabot/examples/ultimate_schedule</em></strong> folder. You can open the code with any editor and fix it. This will be easy, since there are comments in important parts of the code.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-configure-the-script-correctly">How to configure the script correctly</h2>

<p>To ensure that your account has not been banned, you need to configure the script Example. Suppose we need to keep photos on the hashtag every minute. First of all, time in seconds. Open <strong><em>like_hashtags.py</em></strong> with a text editor. Find such lines (approximately so they should look).</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">bot</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Bot</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">bot</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">login</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">u</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">password</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">,</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next in line.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">bot</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Bot</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We need to write a parameter in parentheses. This parameter is <strong><em>like_delay</em></strong>. This parameter needs to be set to 60, since we need every minute the bot to be happy with the photo on the hashtag. In the end, it will look like this.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">bot</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Bot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">like_delay</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">60</span><span class="p">)</span>
