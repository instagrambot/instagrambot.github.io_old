### Article

#### [Struct References](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/references/)

> Recently I was trying to find a good use for Swift’s new keypaths. This post shows one example that accidentally came up. This is something I’ve researched, and not something I’ve used in production code. That said, I think it’s very cool and I’d like to show it.

#### [A favorite hack](https://david-smith.org/blog/2017/07/07/a-favorite-hack/)

> In my latest update to Pedometer++ I had to remove the feature where you could badge your app’s icon with your current step count. In doing so I also removed one of the all time favorite hacks I’ve ever written. I felt that this deserved a little send off before it departs off into my Git history.

#### [Customizing the file header comment and other text macros in Xcode 9](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/07/xcode-9-text-macros/)

> I’m not a fan of the default file header comment Xcode adds to new source files. I’d argue that most of the information in the file header is either irrelevant or better tracked through source control. Moreover, these comments can quickly become outdated as files and projects get renamed.

<br>

#### [All about Concurrency in Swift - Part 2: The Future](https://www.uraimo.com/2017/07/22/all-about-concurrency-in-swift-2-the-future/)

> In the first part of this series we have seen what you’ll have to deal with when working with concurrency, how to reason about some typical multithreading problems, what you’ll need to pay special attention to, and we’ve also looked into some of the traditional instruments we have at our disposal when writing Swift applications.
