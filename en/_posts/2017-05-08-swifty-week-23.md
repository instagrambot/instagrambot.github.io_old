This is the **#23** article. I couldn't update this blog last week because of my vacation. I'll continue to create a simple blog from now on:) Don't worry!

### Article

#### [View Models at Kickstarter](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E47-view-models-at-kickstarter)

> Brandon from Kickstarter joins us and shows how the company uses view models to write highly testable code. We integrate Apple Pay payments and look at Kickstarter's open-source codebase.

#### [5 Predictions for WWDC17](http://www.buddybuild.com/blog/5-predictions-about-wwdc17)

> Every year a pilgrimage to WWDC happens for thousands of developers. From far and wide they descend on California in the United States for a week full of Apple goodness. There’s bands, tech-talks, meetups, happy hours, awards and even selfies. For those of us who didn't get lucky in the raffle this year, or who live further abroad, we’ll likely gather at a local company with fellow devs, to watch and react to the announcements live. I know that's exactly what I'll be doing at around 5 AM, equipped with breakfast and excitement.

#### [Preserves Superview Layout Margins](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/preserves-superview-layout-margins/)

> Ever wondered what the “Preserve Superview Margins” checkbox does in Interface Builder? When should you use it and why does it not seem to do anything most of the time? Here are my notes along with an extra step you will need to make it work with stack views.

<br>

#### [Deriving Equatable and Hashable conformance](https://gist.github.com/allevato/2fd10290bfa84accfbe977d8ac07daad)

> Developers have to write large amounts of boilerplate code to support equatability and hashability of complex types. This proposal offers a way for the compiler to automatically derive conformance to Equatable and Hashable to reduce this boilerplate, in a subset of scenarios where generating the correct implementation is known to be possible.

<br>

#### [Object-oriented programming and third party dependencies](https://www.upbeat.it/2017/05/01/object-oriented-programming-and-third-party-dependencies/)

> Third party dependencies are like candies. Too many are detrimental, but some here and there don’t hurt a lot, as long as you keep them under control. And the smaller, the better.

#### [Overriding methods with default parameter values in Swift](http://blog.xoul.kr/2016/12/23/swift-override-func-default-parameter-values.html)

> I tried a lot with many ways and came up with the solution: marking original method unavailable.

<br>

#### [Readable Swift: The Curious Case of Not](http://www.figure.ink/blog/2017/5/7/readable-swift-the-curious-case-of-not#n1back)

> Before a thing can be read, it must be seen. And this is a problem with Swift's1 "not" operator: !. It's comparatively thin so it doesn't leave a lot of ink on the page. And unlike a . or ,, it's also tall, so it isn't able to use its negative space to stake out territory.

#### [Haptic Feedback makes you vibrate!](https://engineering.nodesagency.com/articles/iOS/Haptic-feedback-makes-you-vibrate/)

> The iPhone could vibrate ever since it was launched. And so did almost all the other phones, even from before smartphones were a thing. But Apple took this function further than anyone else, by introducing the Taptic Engine in the Apple Watch, and afterwards in many other products, like the new MacBooks and iPhones. The Taptic Engine provides haptic feedback, more similar to real-life touches than standard vibration.

I didn't know `taptic` is from `haptic` and `tap`.
