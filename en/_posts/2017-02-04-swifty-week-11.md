This is the **#11** article. I now work on Ruby project in my work. It's interesting to know the difference between [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift) and [Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby).

I read a book called [REMOTE](https://37signals.com/remote). I think it's worth reading if you'd like to improve your work style.

This is a Swift3 migration in Carthage by @ikesyo. Take a look at [this PR](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/pull/1736) for learning.
In addition, you can check how to use Realm notifications from the [PR](https://github.com/realm/RealmTasks/pull/352) in real projects.

### Article

#### [Map, It iterates, applies, transforms, collects. It's your functional best friend, map.](https://swiftunboxed.com/open-source/map/)

> It iterates, applies, transforms, collects. It's your functional best friend, map.

```swift
public func map<T>(_ transform: (Iterator.Element) throws -> T) rethrows -> [T] {
```

#### [Beyond Constraints: Crafting Advanced iOS Animations with Auto Layout](https://savvyapps.com/blog/advanced-ios-animations-with-auto-layout)

> How we think about design at Savvy Apps encouraged us to develop a new animation technique that mixes old-school view animations with Auto Layout. Our technique bypasses the restrictions placed on developers when they try to animate using Auto Layout. Most Auto Layout animation guides say basically the same thing: update constraints and animate. For more advanced animations though, just updating the constraints would be nearly impossible.

#### [Using 'swift package fetch' in an Xcode project](https://www.cocoawithlove.com/blog/package-manager-fetch.html)

> Up until now, the Cocoa with Love git repositories have included their dependencies as “git subtrees” where each dependency is copied and statically hosted within the depender. I want to replace this arrangement with a more dynamic dependency management while remaining totally transparent to users of the library.

<br>

#### [The iOS App Life Cycle](http://juliageist.com/blog/ios-development-swift-3/app-life-cycle/)

> What happens when a user clicks on an app to launch it? How does tapping on an icon from the home screen actually get to my code running in a ViewController? Why is it useful to know what the App Life Cycle is? Well, when you know how a tool is working underneath the hood, you're able to make informed decisions about how to best use it!

#### [Using the Speech Recognition API in iOS 10](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-the-speech-recognition-api-in-ios-10--cms-28032)

> Siri has been a core feature of iOS since it was introduced back in 2011. Now, iOS 10 brings new features to allow developers to interact with Siri. In particular, two new frameworks are now available: Speech and SiriKit.

<br>

#### [Clean Code for Multiple Storyboards](https://medium.com/@gurdeep060289/clean-code-for-multiple-storyboards-c64eb679dbf6#.mdp0id2av)

> Even though storyboards have been around iOS5, many developers are reluctant to use them, specially in large projects. Though I prefer using storyboards, I’ve to admit developers despising storyboards aren’t totally wrong.

<br>

#### [Classes That Conform To Protocols](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/classes-and-protocols/)

> The other day, someone asked how to have a variable which stores a UIView that also conforms to a protocol. In Objective-C, you would simply write UIView<HeaderViewProtocol>. In current Swift, you can’t write something like that. This posts shows a two workarounds.

<br>

#### [Going back to the roots](http://ilya.puchka.me/going-back-to-the-roots/)

> As Roy Marmelstein said in his recent presentation at dotSwift - "We love to be excited". Can not agree more. When we read a blog post that describes the concept or architectural pattern that is somewhat new for us and feels exciting we tend to accept it as something good. We can go really far away this rote and sometimes we don't notice that we already have all the tools to solve the problems they address. For iOS developers this tool is a framework that we inevitably use every day - UIKit.

#### [Challenge: Filtering associated value enumeration arrays](http://ericasadun.com/2017/01/31/challenge-filtering-associated-value-enumeration-arrays/)

> Since I didn’t really get very far with this, I’m throwing this out there as an open challenge. Can you come up with a parsimonious, readable, and less horrible (I was going to say “more elegant”, but c’mon) way to approach this? I suspect my first attempt may be the best one, which would make me sad.

<br>

#### [Introducing Lottie](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/introducing-lottie-4ff4a0afac0e#.j0unjudm3)

> Today, we’re happy to introduce our solution. Lottie is an iOS, Android, and React Native library that renders After Effects animations in real time, and allows native apps to use animations as easily as they use static assets. Lottie uses animation data exported as JSON files from an open-source After Effects extension called Bodymovin. The extension is bundled with a JavaScript player that can render the animations on the web. Since February of 2015, Bodymovin’s creator, Hernan Torrisi, has built a solid foundation by adding features and improvements to the plugin on a monthly basis. Our team (Brandon Withrow on iOS, Gabriel Peal on Android, Leland Richardson on React Native, and I on experience design) began our journey by building on top of Torrisi’s phenomenal work.

#### [An Introduction to the Swift Package Manager](https://www.raywenderlich.com/148832/introduction-swift-package-manager)

> The Swift Package Manager will help to vastly improve the Swift ecosystem, making Swift much easier to use and deploy on platforms without Xcode such as Linux. The Swift Package Manager also addresses the problem of dependency hell that can happen when using many interdependent libraries. It is important to note that as of Swift 3 the Swift Package Manager only compiles for host platforms. In other words, for now you won’t be able to build or consume packages for for iOS, watchOS, or tvOS. Time to get started!

<br>

#### [Setting up SwiftLint on Travis CI](https://alexplescan.com/posts/2016/03/03/setting-up-swiftlint-on-travis-ci/)

> SwiftLint is a great tool for enforcing code conventions in your Swift projects. You can use it locally while you develop, but having it run as part of your continuous integration process makes sure that any contributions made to your project are checked for good code style too.

### Slide

#### [Realm: How I Learned to Love Databases Again](https://realm.io/news/iosconfsg-tim-oliver-how-i-learned-realm/)

> iOS provides two system level database frameworks: SQLite and Core Data. While both of these frameworks are great at what they do, they both have high learning curves and require a fair amount of boilerplate code in order to get started. Realm is a new database framework wholly designed from scratch to make persisting data easier than that. In this iOS Conf SG talk, Tim Oliver introduces Realm and contrasts it to his experiences with SQLite and Core Data. He also demonstrates how to get started coding with it, best implementation practices, and how to migrate an existing app.

<br>

#### [Operators and Strong Opinions](https://realm.io/news/slug-erica-sadun-operators-strong-opinions/)

> Swift operators are flexible and powerful. They’re symbols that behave like functions, adopting a natural mathematical syntax: for example, 1 + 2 versus add(1, 2). However, it’s important that you treat them like potential Swift Kryptonite. In this talk from the Swift Language User Group, Erica Sadun discusses why your operators should be few, well-chosen, and heavily used. There’s even a fun interactive quiz! Play along with “Name That Operator!” and learn about an essential Swift best practice.

#### [Rubik's Cubes and Genetic Algorithms in Swift](https://www.skilled.io/u/swiftsummit/rubik-s-cubes-and-genetic-algorithms-in-swift)

> There's this little, fun side project that I built during a weekend. It's a little Rubik's Cube library in Swift, in a genetic solver algorithm. I'm by no means an expert in anything related to this field. I probably know more about the biology side of things, and the computer science side of things, and that's not saying much. I found it incredibly fun, and really, really fascinating. I would love to share that with you today.

<br>

#### [Creating the Future](https://realm.io/news/altconf-ken-case-creating-the-future/)

> At the Omni Group, we’re working hard to make iPad Pro the best platform it can be. When Tim Cook introduced iPad Pro last September, he said: “iPad is the clearest expression of our vision of the future of personal computing: a simple, multi-touch piece of glass that instantly transforms into virtually anything that you want it to be.” I still find that vision as compelling as when we decided to go “iPad or Bust!” when iPad was introduced in 2010, and if we truly want to achieve that vision we still have a lot of work to do to bring more of the power of the desktop to that transforming piece of glass.

#### [Scaling open source communities](https://krausefx.com/blog/scaling-open-source-communities)

> Not too long ago I started an open source project called fastlane. Just a month after publishing, it had 1000+ stars on GitHub and was beginning to get used by lots of serious tech companies around the world. Soon I was the sole maintainer of a project getting 10+ PRs/day, and spending 8+hrs/day reviewing PRs and replying to questions on GitHub. This is the story of some of the challenges I faced when scaling the project to where it is today: a OSS project stewarded by Twitter and now Google, with over 12k commits, 13k stars, 500+ contributors, and one of the top 25 most active open source projects on GitHub (spoiler alert: I didn't do it alone).

#### [Computer Scientist's Trivia](https://keon.io/cs/computer-scientists-trivia/index.html)

> It is crucial for programmers to understand how long a certain operation takes in and out of a computer. For example, fetching a word from cache, memory, disk, and from other computers.
Inspired by Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years, I would like to discuss this in a little more detail. (Most information is taken from here)

#### [A Little Local Project](http://beckyhansmeyer.com/2017/02/02/a-little-local-project/)

> When people ask me what I do, I tell them I’m a stay-at-home mom. I say it quickly, hoping the conversation will be whisked along to something else before my husband can interject—as he typically does—with “and she also makes apps.” At that point I blush and explain that I don’t really know what I’m doing and no, I can’t really show them anything I’ve made.
