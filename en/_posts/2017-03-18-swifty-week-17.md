This is the **#17** article. I saw a lot of Github repositories related to a career.

- [kdn251/interviews](https://github.com/kdn251/interviews)
- [kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)  
- [bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer)  
etc...

I was really surprised by their Github stars!!

### Article

#### [System Level Breakpoints in Swift](http://indiestack.com/2017/03/system-level-breakpoints-in-swift/)

> Appleâ€™s mapping of Objective-C API to Swift creates an altogether more enjoyable programming experience for Swift developers, but it can lead to great confusion if you donâ€™t understand some of the implementation details, or how to work around lack of understanding. I hope this article gives you the tools you need to debug your Swift apps, and the Objective-C code that you are unavoidably leveraging, more effectively.

#### [Common unit testing techniques on iOS](http://www.marisibrothers.com/2017/03/common-unit-testing-techniques-on-ios.html)

> TL;DR - Most if not all unit test cases on iOS can follow the same commonly known pattern: GIVEN a set of initial conditions, WHEN something happens, THEN something is expected.

#### [Introducing Plank: Immutable model generation for iOS](https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/introducing-plank-immutable-model-generation-for-ios-4b2f64bda00c#.v3otal3ke)

> Plank is a valuable tool for building and scaling an immutable model layer. Generating code has saved us a lot of developer time and eliminated risk for common errors. Itâ€™s been tested heavily in production at Pinterest over the last year, and weâ€™re excited to share this technology with the community.

Docs are [here](https://pinterest.github.io/plank/docs/getting-started/installation.html).

#### [Simple Swift dependency injection with functions](https://medium.com/@johnsundell/simple-swift-dependency-injection-with-functions-7b0ec5b49e60#.i96nx6ukv)

> Most of the time, we use protocols to enable dependency injection in Swift. For example, letâ€™s say weâ€™re writing a simple card game, where we use a randomizer to draw a random card from a deck

I always enjoy @johnsundell's article about Swift:)

This gist is also interesting one!

#### [Swift Needs a Scope Keyword](http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/158514342165/swift-needs-a-scope-keyword)

> Swiftâ€™s namespacing is great. Itâ€™s quite common now to see nested types
