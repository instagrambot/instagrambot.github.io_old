### Article

#### [DRYing up duplicate code into helper functions](https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2017/06/DRYing-up-duplicate-code-into-helper-functions.html)

> During a code review, it’s not uncommon for a reviewer to comment, “it looks like there’s some duplication here; can you please DRY this code up?” We often assume it’s clear what this comment means. But it’s worth examining what the reviewer is asking for, and why it’s important.

#### [#311: Round Corner Improvements ✅](https://littlebitesofcocoa.com/311-round-corner-improvements)

> Today we're going to talk about corners. Specifically, rounded ones. In iOS 11, Apple has improved the way we can specify and work with the rounding of our views' corners. Let's take a look.

<br>

#### [WWDC 2017](https://cjwirth.com//2017/06/16/wwdc-2017/)

> On a selfish level, though what I’m most excited about is the new Xcode 9, with all the new features that will make my day-to-day a lot better! We can finally refactor Swift code!

<br>

#### [The surprising awesomeness of Grouped Dictionaries](http://ericasadun.com/2017/06/14/the-surprising-awesomeness-of-grouped-dictionaries/)

<br>

#### [The Unexpected Joy of Vector Images in iOS 11](http://ericasadun.com/2017/06/15/the-unexpected-joy-of-vector-images-in-ios-11/)

> Enter WWDC 2017. In Session 201 “What’s New in Cocoa Touch”, Apple described Asset Catalogs with PDF-backed vector images. All you have to do is tick the “Preserve Vector Data” checkbox.

<br>

#### [The startling uniquing of Swift 4 dictionaries](http://ericasadun.com/2017/06/19/the-startling-uniquing-of-swift-4-dictionaries/)

> As you’ve probably heard, Swift 4 now has multiline strings.

<br>

#### [Catching Leaky View Controllers Without Instruments](http://holko.pl/2017/06/26/checking-uiviewcontroller-deallocation/)

> One of the well-known techniques for finding memory leaks caused by retain cycles is checking if all view controllers get deallocated when they’re not on screen anymore. This is a process that should be manually repeated before each release but it’s both unpleasant and error-prone. Wouldn’t it be cool if we could learn about UIViewController leaks earlier in the process, during the day-to-day development?

<br>

#### [Exploring the new String API in Swift 4](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/exploring-the-new-string-api-in-swift-4)

> This week, let’s take a look at how it is to work with strings in Swift 4, and how we can take advantage of the new, improved API in various situations.

#### [Enums as configuration: the anti-pattern](http://www.jessesquires.com/blog/enums-as-configs/)

> One of the most common patterns I see in software design with Objective-C (and sometimes Swift), is the use of enumeration types (enum) as configurations for a class. For example, passing an enum to a UIView to style it in a certain way. In this article, I explain why I think this is an anti-pattern and provide a more robust, modular, and extensible approach to solving this problem.

### Slide

#### [Chris Lattner on the Realm WWDC 2017 Swift panel](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/06/chris-lattner-wwdc-swift-panel/)

> Chris Lattner was a guest on a Swift panel during WWDC a few weeks ago. Here are some quotes I found interesting, edited for brevity and clarity. (Iʼm focusing on Chris Lattner here, but the other panelists — Kamilah Taylor, Kevin Ballard, and Jesse Squires — also had interesting things to say. You should really watch the whole thing if you can.)
