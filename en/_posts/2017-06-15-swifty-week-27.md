### Article

#### [WWDC 2017 Initial Impressions](https://www.raywenderlich.com/163940/wwdc-2017-initial-impressions)

> As the iOS team lead at raywenderlich.com, I thought it would be useful to write a quick post sharing some of my initial reactions to all of the new announcements.

<br>

#### [11 Biggest Things in iOS 11](http://five.agency/11-biggest-things-in-ios-11/)

> As a digital product agency, June and September come as something like Christmas and Easter to Christians, with the prior, usually focusing on the software. In this year’s WWDC we saw quite a few software, and interestingly enough, hardware improvements to Apple products. As we are not Mashable or TechCrunch, we waited a few days for the dust to settle, and chose our top 11 new things in iOS 11 (without any specific order).

#### [Loose coupling using default implementations in protocol extensions](http://www.apokrupto.com/blog-1/2017/5/16/default-protocol-extensions-for-loose-coupling)

> When setting up Firebase in your app you have to call an API to configure it. It should be done once, at launch time, so you know where this is headed, you put it in the AppDelegate. Or at least that's what you're told to do.

#### [WWDC 2017: Implementing Apple's Drag and Drop](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/wwdc-2017-implementing-apples-drag-and-drop/)

> Drag and Drop makes it easier to get work done on an iPad by allowing you to drag links, text, images and documents between apps in a way that was never possible. For example, creating a note in the Notes app with text and photos from a website was a tedious task composed of copying and pasting each item. With Drag and Drop, I am able to grab multiple types of items at once from the webpage and drop them all at once in my note.

#### [Building Swift Projects In Source Compatibility Mode](http://dduan.net/2017/05/22/build-in-swift-compatibility-mode/)

> it’s time to try build your Swift projects in the compiler’s compatibility mode!

<br>

#### [Tests that don’t crash](http://ericasadun.com/2017/05/27/tests-that-dont-crash/)

> Most people that have been writing Swift code for a while try to limit their usage of optional force unwraps and try! as much as possible. Test code, on the other hand, is often still littered with unsafe code. It’s true that crashes in tests aren’t nearly as undesirable as in production code, but it’s fairly straight-forward to write tests that fail gracefully when an unexpected nil is encountered, or when an error is thrown unexpectedly.

<br>

#### [Using memory addresses for hashing](http://ericasadun.com/2017/06/01/using-memory-addresses-for-hashing/)

> Today, Tim talks about conforming reference types to a hashable program. This enables you to use specific class instances for set elements and dictionary keys. Read on to learn more and don’t forget to follow Tim on Twitter.

<br>

#### [Even Swiftier Objective-C](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/even-swiftier-objective-c/)

> Another fascinating WWDC is behind us. This year we again witnessed a whole host of newly presented features and refinements to the Swift language, now already in its fourth installment. It's great to see how the language has progressed over the last couple years. Unfortunately, since binary compatibility has been delayed further (at least there's a Manifesto now), and module stability is still even further away, we are unable to use Swift in our binary PSPDFKit SDK. However, we do use it for our tests and in PDF Viewer.
