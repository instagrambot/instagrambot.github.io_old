This is the **#22** article. Apple went public [Environment](https://www.apple.com/environment/) landing page. I always admire such a activity.

I didn't know this way...

### Article

#### [The opinionated Tao of Optional Mappage](http://ericasadun.com/2017/04/20/the-opinionated-tao-of-optional-mappage/)

> I’ve often thought that forEach would be a better approach for procedural calls than map when working with optionals. This is based on the often disputed notion that optionals are like tiny collections with either zero or one members.

<br>

#### [Synchronizing data with CloudKit](https://medium.com/@guilhermerambo/synchronizing-data-with-cloudkit-94c6246a3fda)

> Apple introduced CloudKit in 2014. Since then, it has received many improvements, like the ability to use it outside Apple's platforms and to use it on apps distributed outside the App Store on the Mac.

<br>

#### [Scripting and Compiling Swift on the Command Line](http://jblevins.org/log/swift)

> Apple’s Swift programming language is most widely used for iOS and macOS development in Xcode, however, it can also be used in a manner more like a traditional Unix shell script or even compiled into an executable using the command line. Below, I give some examples of these alternative uses.

<br>

#### [Anonymous nil](http://www.mczarnik.com/2017/03/25/anonymous-nil.html)

> Anonymous nil is a subtle code smell that is present in many codebases. What is it? Why is it a problem? How can we solve it? Let’s take a brief, made up and very contrived example. Let’s say there is a method in your codebase that shows view with an animation.

<br>

#### [Break Out of reduce](http://www.mczarnik.com/2017/04/08/break-out-of-reduce.html)

> reduce is a very useful method in Swift Standard Library. It works like a for in loop (it is the one in fact), but it’s designed specifically to calculate a single value out of the elements in the collection… There is only one difference.

<br>

#### [Stupid Swift Tricks: Sleepsort](http://ericasadun.com/2017/04/18/stupid-swift-tricks-sleepsort/)

> Was chatting today about the freestanding old style partition function and the new one that’s part of SE-0120. One thing led to another and I was writing sleepsort in a playground.

<br>

#### [Getting Hurt With Swift Protocol Extensions & Default Parameter Values](https://marcosantadev.com/getting-hurt-protocol-extensions-default-parameter-values/)

> In this article, I’ll show you how to get hurt using protocol extensions and default parameter values together. If you don’t know well these two features, no worries, I’ll explain them, briefly, in the first two paragraphs—feel free to skip them if you know well the subjects.
