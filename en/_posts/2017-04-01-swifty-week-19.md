#### [Swift 3.1 Released!](https://swift.org/blog/swift-3-1-released/)

> Swift 3.1 is now officially released! Swift 3.1 is a minor release that contains improvements and refinements to the Standard Library. Thanks to efforts by IBM and other members of the community, it also includes many updates to the Linux implementation of Swift. There are also a number of updates to Swift Package Manager.

#### [What’s New in Swift 3.1?](https://www.raywenderlich.com/156352/whats-new-in-swift-3-1)

> In this article, I’ll highlight the most significant changes in Swift 3.1 which will have a major impact on your code. Let’s dive in! :]

`Performance Refinement of Data` is really great! The doc has a visible data!

#### [The Magic of Sourcery](https://www.caseyliss.com/2017/3/31/the-magic-of-sourcery)

> Sourcery is a code generation tool for Swift. It is particularly well suited for auto-generating code that is very repitious; code most developers refer to as “boilerplate”. 

If you'd like to know more, I wrote about Sourcery before. [AutoEquatable and AutoHashable by Sourcery](https://pixyzehn.com/2017/03/09/autoequatable-and-autohashable-by-sourcery.html).

#### [Keeping XCTest in sync on Linux](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/03/keeping-xctest-in-sync/)

> Since the Objective-C runtime is not available on Linux and the Swift runtime currently lacks equivalent functionality, XCTest on Linux requires the developer to provide an explicit list of tests to run.

<br>

#### [You Probably Don't Want enumerated](http://khanlou.com/2017/03/you-probably-don't-want-enumerated/)

> One often-misused piece of the Swift standard library is Sequence’s enumerated() function. This function give you a new sequence with each element in the original sequence and a number that corresponds to that element.

<br>

#### [A Quick Look at Semaphores in Swift](https://medium.com/swiftly-swift/a-quick-look-at-semaphores-6b7b85233ddb)

> Semaphores are a little nice concept that can be very handy in many applications. Just, be careful: look both ways before crossing.

<br>

#### [IB Free in Practice 1: Managing a Modal](https://www.raizlabs.com/dev/2017/03/ibfree-practice-1-managing-modal/)

> This series of blog posts will provide examples of how we develop Swift applications without IB and demonstrate some general strategies for app architecture. For this first post, I’m going to cover presenting and dismissing a modal view controller over a home view controller

I could learn some tips for IB free project! It's worth reading! [Anchorage](https://github.com/Raizlabs/Anchorage) is also great.

### Slide

#### [How does complier see your app by Konstantin](https://speakerdeck.com/konstantinkoval/how-does-complier-see-your-app)

> What is a compiler. What part's it consist of. Why should you even care about it and learn

<br>

#### [Swift's Pointy Bits: Unsafe Swift & Pointer Types](https://realm.io/news/nate-cook-tryswift-tokyo-unsafe-swift-and-pointer-types/)

> Swift offers remarkable performance while still providing safety through strong types, value semantics, and automatic memory management. For those times when you need to step outside those boundaries, however, Swift also offers tools to directly allocate and manipulate memory. This talk will explore the ins and outs of Swift’s take on pointers: typed and raw pointers and buffers, implicit bridging and casting, and some tips on how to stay safe while using unsafe APIs.

### Podcast

#### [23. Metaprogramming (Objective-C vs Swift)](https://fatalerror.fm/episodes/2017/3/26/23-metaprogramming-objective-c-vs-swift)

> This week, Chris and Soroush try to compare Objective C and Swift, but end up talking about metaprogramming a lot.

<br>

#### [Episode 276: I’m Going To Say Yes](http://www.coreint.org/2017/03/episode-276-im-going-to-say-yes/)

> Manton and Daniel discuss the opening of the WWDC ticket lottery, the correlated announcements about details of the WWDC Bash location, and Apple’s promotion of 3rd party events happening in the orbit of the conference. Manton reflects on his new decision to say yes to public speaking, and Daniel takes stock of recent reading around a “Going Pro” mentality. Finally, they react to the new ability for developers to reply to App Store reviews, and whether and how developers should choose to do so.

<br>

#### [04: Bridging with Objective-C](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/61852)

> Swift has evolved since 1.x to have a fluctuating amount of magic/implicit bridging from ObjC and Foundation types, sometimes going in the opposite direction towards very explicit type conversions. We've started seeing more of what the "steady state" looks like as Swift 3.x/4.x development matures.
