This is the **#12** article. I changed to this cool font called [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) in my editor. So far so comfortable!     
In this week, I suddenly faced Instapaper Maintenance. But they officially reveal the reason in their blog. ([Extended Outage](http://blog.instapaper.com/post/157027537441))

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="fr" dir="ltr">503 Maintenance - Instapaper <a href="https://t.co/6sVz6Hcci8">https://t.co/6sVz6Hcci8</a> <a href="https://t.co/o3H3YXMOLQ">pic.twitter.com/o3H3YXMOLQ</a></p>&mdash; Hiroki Nagasawa (@pixyzehn) <a href="https://twitter.com/pixyzehn/status/829497955069472768">February 9, 2017</a></blockquote>

Now Instapaper is back!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you for your patience while we work toward a full resolution to this issue and move forward. We really appreciate it!</p>&mdash; Instapaper (@instapaper) <a href="https://twitter.com/instapaper/status/829898395913433088">February 10, 2017</a></blockquote>

Thank you for providing such a great service again:) I heavily rely on Instapaper for collecting a ton of useful articles.

Anyway, Let‚Äôs move on today‚Äôs topic as usual!

### Article

#### [Reactive MVVM](http://www.thomasvisser.me/2017/02/09/mvvm-rx/)

> The MVVM architecture and the Reactive Programming paradigm can be combined to form a very pleasing approach to iOS app development. However, there‚Äôs no clear-cut way of incorporating the two, and the details of the implementation determine how testable, flexible or concise your code is. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs interesting to look at a specific implementation, as we‚Äôll do in this post today.

<br>

#### [Firebase Remote Config and Swift](https://liamnichols.github.io/2017/02/06/firebase-remote-config-and-swift.html)

> So you‚Äôve seen Firebase Remote Config and decided that it would go great in your Swift project? You‚Äôre right, it will but if like me you‚Äôve noticed that the design of the SDK doesn‚Äôt play very well with all of your other beautiful looking strictly typed Swift code then this post is for you.

<br>

#### [A Sorted Array Implementation in Swift](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/02/sorted-array/)

> In last week ºs Swift Talk episode, Florian and Chris wrote a SortedArray type: an array that keeps its elements sorted according to a given sort predicate at all times. This is great because it encodes one more invariant in the type system ‚Äî clients that use this type in place of a regular Array never have to worry about accidentally forgetting to keep the array sorted manually.

<br>

#### [Retrospective: Swift at Artsy](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/)

> This post will cover: What are Artsy's apps?, Swifts positives and negatives for us, React Native, and our 1-year summary.

<br>

#### [Swift Algorithm Club: Swift Merge Sort](https://www.raywenderlich.com/154256/swift-algorithm-club-swift-merge-sort)

> In this tutorial, you‚Äôll walk through one of the classics of sorting algorithms, the merge sort.

You can check other common sorting Algorithms in Swift [here](http://agostini.tech/2017/01/10/implementing-common-sorting-algorithms-in-swift/).

<br>

#### [Building a LISP from scratch with Swift](https://www.uraimo.com/2017/02/05/building-a-lisp-from-scratch-with-swift/)

> In this article, we‚Äôll implement a minimal LISP based on the 1978 paper by John McCarthy titled A Micro-Manual For Lisp - Not The Whole Thruth, that defines a small and self-contained LISP, as a Swift framework that will be able to evaluate strings containing LISP symbolic expressions.

<br>

#### [RxSwift @ NSMeetup](https://gregheo.com/blog/nsmeetup-rx/)

> I started looking into reactive programming and RxSwift late last year, and now it was my turn to be the noob explaining something at a meetup.

<br>

#### [Swift snippet #9‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthen](https://medium.com/swift-snippets/swift-snippet-9-then-6f23ddef0dcf#.j6qb7fkzs)

> Both solutions are great & there‚Äôs nothing wrong with them üëç But I feel safely unwrapping could get little better ü§î Thus I made an extension on Optional & created a function then which executes a closure having its unwrapped value only if some exists! It could be used something like this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/riteshhgupta/358db2ed3b6968ef18880cb28bdb6963.js"></script>

<br>

#### [Why String.CharacterView is not a MutableCollection](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/02/why-is-string-characterview-not-a-mutablecollection/)

> CharacterView does conform to RangeReplaceableCollection but not to MutableCollection. Why? A string is clearly mutable; it seems logical that it should adopt this protocol. Again, we need to consider the protocol ºs semantics.

<br>

#### [EXPLORING KVO ALTERNATIVES WITH SWIFT](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/02/11/swift-kvo-alternatives.html)

> Swift has access to all of the Objective-C APIs, which means that anything you could do with Objective-C you can now do with Swift. However, there are times when it is worth exploring a better, pure-Swift, alternative. This post explores the pros and cons of KVO versus a couple of Swift alternatives.

<br>

#### [Being a Mutable Collection is not Sufficient to be a MutableCollection](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/02/why-is-dictionary-not-a-mutablecollection/)

> The Collection protocol is the basis for collections in Swift. In addition to Collection, the standard library provides four protocols that collections can adopt to document additional capabilities. These protocols refine Collection ‚Äî any type that conforms to one of them must also conform to Collection.

<br>

#### [Swift Equatable and Comparable](http://useyourloaf.com/blog/swift-equatable-and-comparable/)

> Not sure when you should make your Swift types Equatable? What about Comparable? In this post I look at two common situations where using the Swift Standard Library gets easier when you do.

<br>

#### [Promise Internals How I‚Äôve built a Promise/A+ Library in Swift](https://medium.com/@danielemargutti/hydra-promises-swift-c6319f6a6209#.u70wpcqfu)

> In this article I would to give a deeper look inside the architecture of my Promise library: Hydra.

#### [MVVM with Coordinators and RxSwift](https://realm.io/news/mobilization-lukasz-mroz-mvvm-coordinators-rxswift/)

> Every application needs good architecture. In his talk from Mobilization 2016, ≈Åukasz will show you the architecture he uses in his iOS projects: MVVM with coordinators and RxSwift. Not only will he talk about basics, but he‚Äôll include a live code demo, describing what belongs where, controlling the flow using coordinators, testing everything using Quick/Nimble, and making network requests using Moya.

I found a related interesting topic [How I Fight Procrastination and Usually Win](https://www.raywenderlich.com/152259/fight-procrastination-usually-win?utm_source=raywenderlich.com+Weekly&utm_campaign=5aaa201c83-raywenderlich_com_Weekly11_29_2016&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_83b6edc87f-5aaa201c83-415115149).
