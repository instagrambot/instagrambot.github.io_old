This is the **#25** article. I created [PackageBuilder](https://github.com/pixyzehn/PackageBuilder) that builds a simple command-line structure by SwiftPM. If you'd like to know more details, see [this article](https://pixyzehn.com/2017/05/20/packagebuilder.html):)

### Article

#### [Swift Tricks: Searching for Objects by Type](https://timekl.com/blog/2017/05/14/swift-tricks-searching-for-objects-by-type/?utm_campaign=This%2BWeek%2Bin%2BSwift&utm_medium=email&utm_source=This_Week_in_Swift_131)

> It’s very similar to the previous iteration, but the strategic application of lazy saves work in the case that subviews is very large (and the SpecialView isn’t at the end of the array). It also reads fairly concisely, even if you’re unsure what lazy does – and the phrasing of “lazy flat map” lends itself well to searching documentation or other resources.

#### [Getting started with Xcode UI testing in Swift](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/getting-started-with-xcode-ui-testing-in-swift)

> UI testing is a great way to ensure that your most critical UI interactions keep working as you’re adding new features or refactoring your app’s codebase. It’s also a nice way to automate repetitive tasks when working on UI code (when you have to navigate deep into your app in order to test something you’re working on, for example).

### Slide

#### [The Two Sides of Writing Testable Code](http://news.realm.io/news/try-swift-brandon-williams-writing-testable-code/)

> There are precisely two things that make functions fully testable: the isolation of effects and the surfacing of ‘co-effects’. We will explore a bit of the formal theory behind these two sides, and show how they lead to code that can be easily tested. We will also show how we do this at Kickstarter by diving into our recently open sourced codebase.
