This is the **#14** article. In this week, I saw a lot of tweets about [PanelKit](https://github.com/louisdh/panelkit). I hope Apple will have this function by default.

Thank you for updating [Core Data Update](https://www.objc.io/blog/2017/02/21/core-data-swift-3/)!!

> This update brings the book fully up to speed with Swift 3, as well as with the changes in Core Data released with iOS 10 and macOS 10.12. For example, we now take advantage of the generic result types in Core Data‚Äôs API, the new NSPersistentContainer class, concurrency changes to the persistent store coordinator and much more.

I really appreciated [objc.io](https://www.objc.io/) team :tada:

<br>

[Playgroundscon](http://www.playgroundscon.com/) took place in this week. I added some articles in the following list:)

<br>

### Article

#### [Swift Changes Considered Harmful](http://furbo.org/2017/02/17/swift-changes-considered-harmful/)

> I like Swift. We‚Äôre using it for new products like Linea, which was written from the ground up with the new syntax. In spite of this, I still consider the language harmful.

I understand the feeling, but I enjoyed such a drastic change if it is reasonable:)

<br>

#### [SwiftGen 4.2 and other news](http://alisoftware.github.io/news/oss/2017/02/19/swiftgen-4-2-and-other-news/)

> SwiftGen ‚Äî my tool to generate Swift code so you can use your images, localized strings, fonts, storyboards and other assets in a type-safe way ‚Äî has just been released in version 4.2 after a big internal refactoring. I‚Äôve also been working on other OSS projects lately.

I rely on these libraries. I didn't know they refactor them under the hood.

<br>

#### [Migrating Firefox for iOS to Swift 3.0](https://mozilla-mobile.github.io/ios/firefox/swift/core/2017/02/22/migrating-to-swift-3.0.html)

> A week ago we completed the migration of the entire Firefox for iOS project from Swift 2.3 to Swift 3.0. With over 206,000 lines of code, migrating a project of this size is no small feat. Xcode‚Äôs built in conversion tool is a fantastic help, but leaves your codebase in a completely uncompilable state that takes a good long while to resolve.

<br>

#### [Playgrounds conference 2017](https://larder.io/public/belle/playgrounds-conference-2017/)

> Blog posts, slide decks and videos from speakers at Playgrounds 2017 in Melbourne

<br>

#### [Swift Top 10 Articles For The Past Year (v.2017)](https://medium.mybridge.co/swift-top-10-articles-for-the-past-year-e4551a19121#.kl9grywb3)

> For the past year, we‚Äôve ranked nearly 9,000 Swift articles to pick the Top 10 stories (0.11% chance) that can help advance your career in 2017.

Rank 3 is [shu223/iOS-10-Sampler](https://github.com/shu223/iOS-10-Sampler).

<br>

#### [Comparative Asynchronous Programming](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/comparative-asynchronous-programming/)

> So I‚Äôm in Australia to give my talk at Playgrounds Conference about asynchronous programming. While we wait for the video to be edited and uploaded, I thought I could take you through the talk in blog post form. So let‚Äôs dive in!

<br>

#### [Time Machine Utilities: tmdiff, tmcp, and tmls](http://ericasadun.com/2017/02/24/time-machine-utilities-tmdiff-tmcp-and-tmls/)

> Just a quick remember that tmdiff, tmcp, and tmls are available from their respective GitHub repositories. These time machine command line utilities enable you to list backups, diff the current version of a file with a backed up version, and copy from time machine to the current working folder.

<br>

#### [Type erasure using closures in Swift](https://medium.com/@johnsundell/type-erasure-using-closures-in-swift-1e6125231f8#.670c7d3e6)

> One of the things that makes Swift so much safer and less error-prone than many other languages is its advanced (and in a way, unforgiving) type system. It‚Äôs one of the language features that can at times be really impressive and make you a lot more productive, and at other times be really frustrating.

<br>

#### [RAS S1E2](http://codeplease.io/2017/02/22/ras-s1e2/)

> In my mind there are two ways of thinking about composition, when we have FRP or FP in the mix. The first one is often mentioned when compared to inheritance1:

<br>

#### [Divide and conquer](http://ppinera.es/2017/02/16/divide-and-conquer.html)

> More and more we see companies that run away from Xcode to try the dynamism of languages like Javascript on their mobiles apps.

<br>

#### [Five Unbelievable Secrets of Reactive Programming the Experts Don't Want You to Know!](https://gregheo.com/blog/reactive-programming-basics/)

> Based on a talk given at Playgrounds in Melbourne, February 24, 2017.

<br>

#### [Swift JSON Tutorial: Working with JSON](https://www.raywenderlich.com/150322/swift-json-tutorial-2)

> Updated for Xcode 8.2 and Swift 3 on 1-15-2017 by Luke Parham. The original tutorial was written by Attila Heged√ºs.

<br>

#### [The learning materials list for RxSwift](http://adamborek.com/rxswift-materials-list/)

> Reactive programming is awesome and really makes complex I/O stuff simple. However, FRP is totally different approach how you look at the events and programming. Such a change in thinking requires good quality materials which can make the learning process simpler and quicker. Here‚Äôs the list of materials which I‚Äôve read and I‚Äôve found them useful. The list is sorted in an order I would like to read it üòâ

<br>

#### [Swift Integer Quick Guide](http://useyourloaf.com/blog/swift-integer-quick-guide/)

> If you are new to Swift and have some experience with ‚ÄúC‚Äù style languages you probably have not given the Swift integer types much thought. They mostly work as you expect until one day something catches you out.

<br>

#### [Why I created Rock for Swift CLIs](https://medium.com/@vknabel/why-i-created-rock-for-swift-clis-eb5c12a8e57d#.1uipmrk9o)

> I excessively make use of the official Swift Package Manager as I usually do some CLIs or other stuff. For this use case it is really great. When developing Apps, Carthage and CocoaPods come in handy, which are great, too.

<br>

#### [XCTest and Optional Unwrapping](https://www.raizlabs.com/dev/2017/02/xctest-optional-unwrapping/)

> XCTest is the default test harness on iOS and Apple‚Äôs other platforms. It provides support for organizing test cases and asserting expectations in your application code, and reporting the status of those expectations. It‚Äôs not as fancy as some of the BDD frameworks like Quick and Cedar, but it has gotten much better than it used to be, and is my preferred test framework these days.

<br>

#### [Synchronized Wrapper in Swift](http://kelan.io/2016/synchronized-wrapper-in-swift/)

> This is an idea I've been tinkering with recently, to help enforce thread-safe access to properties in a class instance. It still needs some more refinement, but I wanted to write up my thoughts and progress so far, to start to get feedback.

<br>

#### [Safe segues in Storyboards](https://www.whitesmith.co/safe-segues-in-storyboards/)

> This article is ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è ... or not! I will talk about our Qold¬Æ mobile app and how it was built using Storyboards. I hope that you know already what Qold is but if not then take a look at how it started

### Slide

#### [Deep Dive Into Networking in Swift](https://engineering.tumblr.com/post/157614049236/deep-dive-into-networking-in-swift-swift-has-a)

> Swift has a bunch of cool features that can make networking a lot easier, more expressive, and safer than in Objective-C. Learn about how Tumblr embraced Swift in our networking code and about the architecture of our new networking library.

<br>

#### [Learning From Our Elders: Applying functional insights without losing Swift by Rob Napier](https://vimeo.com/204897590)

> Swift is not a functional programming language. Pushing too hard to make it one fights Swift and breaks Cocoa.
But Swift has absorbed some fantastic lessons from the functional world, and while value types may not quite be the present, they are clearly the future. We‚Äôll explore how decades of work in functional languages have influenced Swift, and how you can use those features best while staying true to Swift.

#### [74: How to Create a Micro-Startup in Japan ‚Äì Patrick McKenzie](http://www.disruptingjapan.com/create-micro-startup-japan-patrick-mckenzie/)

> More than a few people dream of coming to Japan, starting an online business that gives you financial freedom and leaves you with enough free time to study the language travel and just enjoy Japan.

<br>

#### [Invalidating Negativity](http://gwendolyn.io/invalidating-negativity/)

> At the beginning of this year, I started using an app called Moodnotes to start logging my emotions on a regular basis. The result after two weeks of use surprised me: I'm a pretty positive and happy person.

<br>

#### [5 Calls](http://benscheirman.com/2017/02/5-calls/)

<br>

#### [Shell ‚Üí Watch Notifications](https://www.caseyliss.com/2017/2/25/push-it-real-good)

> At work we recently switched from Cocoapods to punic. The reasons why are irrelevant for the purpose of this post. However, one of the traits of using punic is very long build times when you‚Äôre building all your dependencies. On the plus side, builds of our project tend to be pretty quick.
