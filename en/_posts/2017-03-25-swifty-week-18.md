This is the **#18** article. I started to contribute the awesome tool called [Marathon](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Marathon). It's a command line tool that manages scripts in Swift. If you don't know it, check it out:)  
Thanks @JohnSundell!

### Article

#### [Swift enums with associated values defaults](http://ilya.puchka.me/swift-enums-with-associated-values-defaults/)

> In Swift enums are much more powerful than we got used to in other languages. One of the features that makes them more interesting to use is associated values - values that each instance of enum case can carry along with it. We can not have stored properties in the enum, so associated values is basically the only way to store additional data with enum value. Creating an enum value with associated value has a similar semantics as a method call. The difference is - we can not define defaults for parameters which represent associated values.

#### [Swift: Why You Shouldn’t Use Default Implementations in Protocols](https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-use-default-implementations-protocols/)

> I think adding default implementations to protocols should be considered very very carefully. The default needs to be something that is consistent and is the default for most cases, so if someone forgets to implement it (because the compiler won’t complain), it’s most likely not a big deal.

#### [On Comments](http://khanlou.com/2017/03/on-comments/)

> My perspective on comments comes from two facts: 1) Comments don’t compile. 2) Comments are usually a subdued color in your syntax highlighter. Because they don’t compile and because they fade away from sight, it’s very easy to ignore them as you make changes to the code. If you make changes and don’t update the comments, you end up with a comment that doesn’t accurately reflect the content of code.

#### [Swift: When to use guard vs if](https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-when-to-use-guard-vs-if/)

> One thing I’ve noticed recently in my code-base is that I tend to default to guard vs if. In fact, whenever I write an if statement, I facepalm myself and change it to a guard without thinking much.

#### [Variable Height Table View Header](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/variable-height-table-view-header/)

> Making a table view header that automatically adjusts its height to allow its contents to fit should not be so hard. Unfortunately it is a problem that has been with us for a number of years which means much of the advice on how to do it is out of date. This is what works for me for both iOS 9 and iOS 10.
