This is the **#26** article. I posted [A simple tool to make it easy to introduce SwiftLint from zero especially for a new project](https://pixyzehn.com/2017/05/28/linter.html). If you'd like to instroduce SwiftLint in a new project, I'm sure it saves your time:)

### Article

#### [UIDebuggingInformationOverlay](http://ryanipete.com/blog/ios/swift/objective-c/uidebugginginformationoverlay/)

> While browsing UIKitâ€™s private headers recently, I came across a class that I hadnâ€™t seen before - UIDebuggingInformationOverlay. A Google search didnâ€™t turn up much info, so figured Iâ€™d write a short description of what Iâ€™ve found.

#### [Type-Driven Development with Swift](http://matt.diephouse.com/2017/05/type-driven-development-with-swift/)

<br>

#### [Swift one-line type-checking lasting 27s](http://aplus.rs/2017/swift-one-line-type-checking-lasting-27s/)

> In the Swift project I finished recently there was a very strange behavior. At some point I noticed that autocomplete totally stopped working and the indexer was constantly spinning. Only if I would wait for what felt like minutes, things would settled down and it was working fine for a while. Only to re-appear again after I add few more types or methods.

#### [GOING WITHOUT THE FLOW - EXPLORING COLLECTION VIEW LAYOUTS](http://martiancraft.com/blog/2017/05/collection-view-layouts/)

> Collection views are extremely versatile - thereâ€™s even speculation that the venerable UITableView will be soft-deprecated in favour of its more flexible and powerful cousin. But this versatility comes with a price - collection views, and particularly collection view layouts, can become complicated, and the official documentation for some of the more interesting areas is a littleâ€¦ sparse.

> Iâ€™m gonna be talking about the 3D Touch APIs. I currently work as an iOS Engineer at SoundCloud in Berlin, a music streaming app. Just to set the overview of what weâ€™re gonna be going through, first weâ€™re gonna take a look at 3D Touch and why it rocks. Then weâ€™re going to go through how you can integrate this into your app. 3D Touch was first introduced in iOS 9 in 2015. And it was improved upon in iOS 10 last year. There are about five different integrations so weâ€™ll take a tour through each of these. The last thing weâ€™ll look at is a deep dive into the APIs so we can see how we can actually build these integrations into our app.
