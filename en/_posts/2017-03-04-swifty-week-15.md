This is the **#15** article. I attended [try!Swift](https://www.tryswift.co/tokyo/en) Tokyo on March 2nd and 3rd. I had a great time again:)  
I saw a lot of speakers that I know before. Everything was fine for me!!  
You can see how it is through a video after a few weeks:)  

Before try!Swift Tokyo, Playgrounds conference was held. The summary of slide is [here](https://github.com/playgroundscon/Slides).

### Article

#### [Refactoring to Clarity in Swift](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/refactoring-to-clarity-in-swift/)

> My test code started out difficult to follow, but by working on its clarity one step at a time, I ended up with an API I love. (And it turns out it’s exactly the same as an API offered by the Nimble library! I knew it was too good for me to be the first one to think of it!)

<br>

#### [Container View Controllers](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/container-view-controllers/)

> Massive View Controllers are a common pain with iOS development. A quick search will give you much good advice on how to slim down these monsters. In this post I want to give some attention to the often overlooked use of Container View Controllers.

<br>

#### [Comparative Asynchronous Programming](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/comparative-asynchronous-programming/?utm_source=Swift_Developments)

> So I’m in Australia to give my talk at Playgrounds Conference about asynchronous programming. While we wait for the video to be edited and uploaded, I thought I could take you through the talk in blog post form. So let’s dive in!

<br>

#### [Replicating Apple Design Awarded Applications](https://medium.com/exyte/replicating-apple-design-awarded-applications-70e5df4c4b94#.4uybd2316)

> Designers and developers of Apple awarded applications did a great job. But designing is only one part of the work. How difficult was it to turn these designs into native applications with all the custom controls and animations perfected for all screen sizes? In this article, I will show you how easy it can be done by recreating Auxy, Streaks and Zova interfaces.

<br>

#### [Isolating tasks in Swift, or how to create a testable networking layer.](https://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/isolating-tasks-in-swift-or-how-to-create-a-testable-networking-layer-d0380e69f7e3#.3cfxaqclu)

> There are a lot of shiny iOS architectures that are getting more and more hype in the last few years. As they are all valid and have good and bad parts, they all address the same thing: separate the business logic from the presentation. Today, I’m going to write about a simple concept that is applicable to your next project’s architecture, whichever architecture you are planning to use.

<br>

#### [Composable UIs](http://ppinera.es/2017/03/02/composable-uis.html)

> Components can also respond to actions. For example, if you are trying to like a track, that turns into a few background operations to persist the new state into the API and the local store. In case the action response is more complicated and involves some UI, you can delegate de action to the app by using a delegate pattern. As an example, some actions might require a confirmation from the user. That confirmation can be handled from the outside.

### Slide

#### ["Watch Your Language!": The Road to Cleaner Code with SwiftLint](https://realm.io/news/slug-jp-simard-swiftlint/)

> In this Swift Language User Group talk, JP Simard explains exactly how to set up SwiftLint in your project to give you just the semantics you want, and help it stay out of your way while being an ever-watchful protector of code cleanliness.

<br>

#### [Test Driven Development (TDD) for the Masses](https://realm.io/news/cmdu-jorge-ortiz-tdd4masses/)

> In this CMD+U Conference talk, Jorge Ortiz discusses Test Driven Development (TDD) and performs a set of unit tests for a Table View Controller in a live demo.

<br>

#### [Swift sequences: The art of being lazy](https://medium.com/@johnsundell/swift-sequences-the-art-of-being-lazy-5b4bd99b159a)

> When creating lists and sequences of objects in Swift, most of the time we use the Array data structure. While arrays have a huge benefit in being easy to use, and something more or less every programmer on the planet knows about, they do require you to create all of your elements up front.

#### [My 2015 MacBook Pro Retina exploded.](https://medium.com/@dourvaris/my-2015-macbook-pro-retina-exploded-119ea5ea9d1f#.orwtw9lr9)

> One afternoon as I was lying on my bed browsing the internet, my MacBook Pro suddenly turned off. I turned it back on and within a few seconds there was weird hissing sound, followed by white smoke and thin flames coming out of from the back.

Really...?

<br>

#### [Fake Ads as a Business Model](https://oleb.net/blog/2016/03/fake-ads-as-a-business-model/)

> There would neither be user tracking, nor would you have to add shady third-party code from a dozen app networks to your binary. 

<br>

#### [I wrote an application in Objective-c](http://www.upbeat.it/2017/02/28/i-wrote-an-application-in-objective-c/)

> Objective-c is like that leather jacket that you bought in Brooklyn in 1984. There are a few cracks, but when you wear it you feel damn good.

To navigate this change, Joi Ito, Director of the MIT Media Lab and author of Whiplash, shares insights from research at the Lab and offers us nine strategies for surviving our faster future.
