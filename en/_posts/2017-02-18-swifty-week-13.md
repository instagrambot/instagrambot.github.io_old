This is the **#13** article. @tkremenek posted [Swift 4 Release Process](https://swift.org/blog/swift-4-0-release-process/) in the official blog.  
Also, you can check details → [[swift-evolution] Swift 4, stage 2 starts now](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170213/032116.html).  

@rjmccall started to write [the ownership manifesto document](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/OwnershipManifesto.md).

[The post](http://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/whither-swift.html) about a future of Swift makes me think about coexisting.

If you'd like to know only summarization, I recommend to seeing [Swift 4: Release Process and Phase 2](http://ericasadun.com/2017/02/17/swift-4-release-process-and-phase-2/) by @erica or [Deferring ABI Stability From Swift 4](http://mjtsai.com/blog/2017/02/16/deferring-abi-stability-from-swift-4/) by Michael Tsai.

### Article

#### [Swift vs. React Native Feels](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/swift-vs-react-native-feels/)

> The post describes why we made the decision to move all new development into React Native instead of Swift.

<br>

#### [Getting to Swift 3](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/getting-to-swift-3-at-airbnb-79a257d2b656#.6fvqfnafb)

> We want to share with the community our approach to this migration, the effect Swift 3 has had on our app, and some technical insights we gained along the way.

These are practical tips from an Airbnb iOS team!

<br>

#### [How we made Chatto](https://medium.com/badoo-developers/how-we-made-chatto-78b7b224adef#.tlcg3syui)

> Our chat was old, having evolved over the years into a massive view controller with weird fixes that nobody could understand. It was difficult to add new types of messages and new bugs were easily introduced. So we decided to rewrite it from scratch on Swift and make it open source.

<br>

#### [Swift + Keywords (V 3.0.1)](https://medium.com/the-traveled-ios-developers-guide/swift-keywords-v-3-0-1-f59783bf26c)

> So today — we’ll look at every single keyword Swift (v 3.0.1) has to offer us along with some code for each one, all in the name of booking up on our trade’s tools.

<br>

#### [Swift Hashable](http://useyourloaf.com/blog/swift-hashable/)

> I already covered making a custom Swift type Equatable and Comparable which allows us to test if an Array contains an instance of our type or to sort the array amongst other things. What if we want to store our type in a Set or Dictionary?

<br>

#### [That API thing](http://ericasadun.com/2017/02/15/that-api-thing/)

> Today, Nikita Voloboev was trying to wrap his head around how this whole Cocoa/Cocoa Touch API thing worked. The conversation started when he asked, “Is UIKit part of Cocoa?” The docs weren’t really giving him an idea of how it all worked. After a few minutes back and forth, he derived this concept using the tools at minenode.com:

<br>

#### [Swift snippet #10 — remove(d)](https://medium.com/swift-snippets/swift-snippet-10-remove-d-86e6795b673c#.1b6tkuwsb)

> remove — it takes a closure to remove an element that matches the provided condition & returns the removed element. Its a mutating func which means it modifies the host array

The important thing in this function is that mutating(`remove`) or non-mutating(`removed`).

<br>

#### [Touchy-feely](http://www.apokrupto.com/blog-1/2017/2/11/touchy-feely)

> I got a design requirement recently for a button to be placed in the bottom corner of the screen and for it to be the same distance from the trailing margin as the bottom.

`ExtendedTouchable` is really useful.

<br>

#### [Refactoring singleton usage in Swift](http://www.jessesquires.com/refactoring-singletons-in-swift/)

> In software development, singletons are widely discouraged and frowned upon — but with good reason. They are difficult or impossible to test, and they entangle your codebase when used implicitly in other classes, making code reuse difficult. Most of the time, a singleton amounts to nothing more than a disguise for global, mutable state. Everyone knows at least knows that is a terrible idea. However, singletons are occasionally an unavoidable and necessary evil. How can we incorporate them into our code in a clean, modular, and testable way?

@jessesquires recommends to using Dependency injection instead of using Singleton in ViewController. It enables to reuse codes and write tests easily. And `Default parameter values` is good for non-breaking refactoring.

<br>

#### [Providing a unified Swift error API](https://medium.com/@johnsundell/providing-a-unified-swift-error-api-3642cd3173f0#.xtn55a8pa)

> I want to share a technique that I've come to find quite useful when using the Swift do, try, catch error handling model, to limit the amount of errors that can be thrown from a given API call.

I just found an interesting interview post.

#### [Adapting to change](http://www.jessesquires.com/adapting-to-change-and-cutting-corners/)

<br>

#### [Refactoring Slow and Steady](http://robnapier.net/refactoring)

<br>

#### [Accessible Resistance](http://bitsplitting.org/2017/02/10/accessible-resistance/)

#### [How to make a build automatically available to your boss](https://romain-pouclet.com/2017/02/14/how-to-make-a-build-automatically-available-to-your-boss/)

> Everybody works differently but chances are that you’re used to this demand because it happens everyday. It may not be your boss though. Sometimes it’s a Quality Assurance Engineer who needs to see if a bug has been fixed. Sometimes it’s your Project Manager. At every company there is always one person in charge of those demands. Don’t be that person. Today I’m going to show you a way of making a build automatically available for your boss to install.

[Cult of the Party Parrot](http://cultofthepartyparrot.com/) :scream:

I read [Things You Should Never Do, Part I](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/) by Joel on Software. It reminds me of an important mind as an application developer.

If you have any questions and feedbacks about a kind of new Swifty week, feel free to ask me :+1:
You can catch me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pixyzehn) and [Github](https://github.com/pixyzehn).

Have a lovely week <3
