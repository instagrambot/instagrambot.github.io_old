Happy new year :confetti_ball: This is the **#6** article and the first article in 2017. Don't forget to look back on your goal in 2017. Some people say that to put your goal on desktop wallpaper works well. I'll do like this :+1:

I started to use [Danger](http://danger.systems/index.html){:target="_blank"} for my personal project. This is my bot for Danger called [pz-bot](https://github.com/pz-bot){:target="_blank"}. Cool!

### Article

#### [Protocols are more than Bags of Syntax](https://oleb.net/blog/2016/12/protocols-have-semantics/){:target="_blank"}

> Someone pitched the idea to add a protocol named DefaultConstructible to the Swift standard library whose only requirement would be a parameter-less initializer

Discussion on DefaultConstructible.

#### [Why I Prefer Protocol-Oriented-Programming in Objective-C to Swift](http://inessential.com/2016/12/30/why_i_prefer_protocol-oriented-programmi){:target="_blank"}

> at least at this writing at the end of 2016, I still run into problems when I use this style of programming in Swift. Here’s the problem I’m trying to solve:

problems between Swift and Objective-C.

#### [Three Quick Tips](http://www.figure.ink/blog/2016/12/30/brlc8hxfkulf0dm23uk1t1wz0vv45h){:target="_blank"}

> Three quick tips before the new year.

He mentions  

- Stop Using `&&`  
- Give Modules Distinct Names  
- Dealing with Non-distinct Modules  

I like the first tip of them.

#### [Extending Swift generic types](http://www.marisibrothers.com/2016/03/extending-swift-generic-types.html){:target="_blank"}

> Generic Swift types such as Array or Dictionary can be easily extended to provide methods to specific types by making their associated type(s) either conform to a protocol or inherit from a class

If you'd like to create highly reusable and strongly type functions that only work for the type you expect, see this article.

#### [Getting Started with PromiseKit](https://www.raywenderlich.com/145683/getting-started-promises-promisekit){:target="_blank"}

> Asynchronous programming can be a real pain in the lemon. Unless you’re extremely careful, it can easily result in humongous delegates, messy completion handlers and long nights debugging code! Lucky for you, there’s a better way: promises. Promises tame asynchronicity by letting you write code as a series of actions based on events. This works especially well for actions that must occur in a certain order. In this PromiseKit tutorial, you’ll learn how to use the third party PromiseKit to clean up your asynchronous code, and your sanity.

A person who creates `PromiseKit` is also famous for a creator of `Homebrew`.

### Slide

#### [Beyond Crusty: Real-World Protocols](http://www.thedotpost.com/2016/01/rob-napier-beyond-crusty-real-world-protocols){:target="_blank"}

> Apple has declared Swift as the first Protocol Oriented language. If you've tried to write protocol oriented code, you may have discovered that the promise isn't quite the reality. In this talk, you'll learn to rethink your types to avoid protocol problems without giving up their power.

### Random

I have tons of `Random` article that I want to share. Pick them up if you like some.

#### [Craft and Tooling](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/craft-and-tooling/){:target="_blank"}

> But keep in mind that it took skill to do so – skills acquired with better tools. The longer you’ve been working in a field, the less tools will matter to you. Just be aware of your bias when your talking to beginners and you’ll do great!

<br>

#### [FAVORITE THINGS from katiefloyd.com](https://katiefloyd.com/favorite-things/){:target="_blank"}

> I'm regularly asked about the tools I use so I've compiled this list of some of my favorite things, everything from network attached storage to leaf blowers. You can find a random collection below, most of the links are to Amazon or to the App store

<br>

#### [Code is Prose](http://matthewbischoff.com/code-is-prose/){:target="_blank"}

> I first saw the phrase “Code is poetry” pop up on websites and in conversations about the craft of software development in the early 2000s. Popularized by the Wordpress project, the idea that programming and poetry are similar forms has been the subject of Quora questions, as well as pieces in WIRED, Torque, and Smashing Magazine.
